Note: This is a similar problem 

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. 
It should support the following operations:refer() and display().

refer(key) :-  adds the key in the cache if not present, if present updates the cache
complexity of refer() function should be O(1);

The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.
